Some infos for buiding the files:
------------------------------------------

BuildSamples.cmd
 --> lets you build the MOGRE samples for any cpu
 
BuildSamplesX86.cmd
 --> lets you build the samples explicitly for 32-bit processors, 
     so that WOW64 is activated on Windows 64-bit editions.
     Try this if you get a FileNotFoundException or a similar one.


The binaries are not located in the sample subfolders.
They are in MogreSDK/bin/Debug and MogreSDK/bin/Release.
