This is the SVN repository of the Mogre SDK.

Our aim of the SDK is to make it easy for newcomers to get in touch with Mogre.
It contains precompiled binaries of Mogre and some addons. Also there are demo applications.

Unfortunately the SDK currently is not maintained. Nevertheless it contains useful stuff.
For fresh Mogre binaries, tutorials etc. look to our Website and forum.
