
checker_kwertz_c

is the currently used checker for the MogreSDK installer.


Note:

For some depencies it's difficult to check if they are still installed 
in the correct version. Sometimes the check results were wrong. 
So perhaps we should remove some or all checkers from the installer script. 
Instead we could ask the user if he agree to download and install the 
needed external installers.

Details were postet somewhere in the long SDK development forum topic:

There is also a wiki page which contains information about the SDK:
