Some infos for buiding the files:
------------------------------------------

BuildSamplesX86.cmd
 --> lets you build the samples explicitly for 32-bit processors, 
     so that WOW64 is activated on Windows 64-bit editions.
     Try this if you get a FileNotFoundException or a similar one.
     
CleanSamples.cmd
 --> lets you clean the solution after building it with Microsoft
     Visual Studio or one of the BuildSamples* scripts. 


The binaries are not located in the sample subfolders.
They are in MogreSDK/bin/Debug and MogreSDK/bin/Release.
